            <h2>About Skin Cancer</h2>
            <p>Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer, affecting millions of people worldwide each year. It occurs when skin cells grow uncontrollably and form a mass of tissue known as a tumor. If left untreated, skin cancer can spread to other parts of the body and become life-threatening.</p>
